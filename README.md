# JavaScript-beginnersNotes

Declarig a variable:
  var myStr;
  
or wi the value in the same line:
  var myStr = 10;
  
  myStr is equal to 10 but can be reassigned as well with another value:
    myStr = "Thomas";
    
  ## Concatinating
  
  - I can concatinate to variables like so:
      Var myBookCost = 20;
      var iceBreaker = "Hi my book cost me $";
      icebreaker += myBookCost;

  - Concatinating string:
