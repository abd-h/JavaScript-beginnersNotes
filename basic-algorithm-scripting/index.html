    <h2>Basic Algorithm Scripting</h2>

    <p>
        An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.

        To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts, and think carefully about how to
        solve each part with code.
        
        In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from
        converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.
